# PostgreSQL Workflow Example

This project demonstrates how to build and push a PostgreSQL Docker image using GitHub Actions. It includes a Dockerfile for creating the PostgreSQL image and a GitHub Actions workflow for automating the build and push process.

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd postgresql-workflow-example
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:
   Navigate to the `docker` directory and build the image using the Dockerfile:
   ```bash
   cd docker
   docker build -t your-postgres-image-name .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:
   After building the image, you can run it with:
   ```bash
   docker run --name your-container-name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -d your-postgres-image-name
   ```

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/postgres-image.yml` automates the process of building and pushing the Docker image to a container registry whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Usage

You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using the credentials specified in the Docker run command. The main application logic can be found in `src/app.js`, where you can implement your database operations.
